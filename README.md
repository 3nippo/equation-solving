# equation-solving

This is my course work from second semester. I restored it from report screenshots (because i lost source code) and improved structure and logic of the code.

What is this code about?

I was given two equations and it's slutions on the given segments. I had to implement 3 different numerical methods of solving equations and compare my results with the given answers:

```
1) Dichotomy

2) Simple iteration

3) Newton method
```

And I did it. And then I did it on Haskell. And then I did it on Haskell again and uploaded it here, on GitHub.

Console output:

```
